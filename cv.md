## About myself

I've never worked in IT-industry, but since childhood I've liked working with computers. After school I went to University to study programming, but something went wrong, and I changed my education to translation. But a year ago I realized that IT is totally my sphere, so now I'm studying programming at University again. I'm going to learn front-end development and then work in this sphere.
